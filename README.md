# Maths

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

  /////////////////
 /WorkExperience/
/////////////////

On this work expierience I have leart new ways to code wesites and to make things that I didnt know how to do before. I have also learnt how
arrays and loops work and have used them to generate 20 different questions all different to each other and that was something that I didn't 
think I would be able to do or even know how to do.

Therefore I will be able to use these skills in later life if I ever want to become a website desighner or programmer for major or little
compaies.But I will be able to keep this experience with me for the rest of my life and use this whenever I want.

  //////////////
 /Improvements/
//////////////

next time I made a website I would leave myself plenty of time to make a database so that I can save all of the quizes and people can see who
has done the best and try and beat their score. this would make he website more fun and enjoyable for the people using it as they will want to 
beat their friends score and also make them work harder on there maths so that they get a higher score.

I would also make the website look better by adding more pictures and maybe different colours. I would've also made more things to do on the 
website as you can only do the test and it could get boring for the people using it 24/7.

  ////////////
 /New Skills/
////////////

I have learnt how to make websites in a diffferent but more interresting way. And I have learnt how to code in a different way to bootstrap
and make more interesting websites with more to do and talk about.

  ///////////
 /Build App/
///////////

Whilst building the app I ran into a few problems with the coding and had to sort them out. And this helped me because instead of running
into a problem and then just giving up. I had to sort the problem out myself because if I didn't then the website wouldn't work and I would 
have nothing to show for all of the work that I have done.

And building the website taught me new skills on how to build websites in the future and make them more complex and usefull for the person
using my websites in the future.

Also, when building the app I have learnt new ways to make a website and make it function. And this will help me make a better website in the
future and make them more complex and usefull.

  ////////////
 /Deploy App/
////////////

To deploy the app I had to make myself a firebase account, and after that all I had to do was go onto Gitbash and type in firebase login and
then firebase deploy. After that was done all of the websies files were uploaded and made it so my website was open for anyone to see.

  //////////////
 /MakingChages/
//////////////

Making changes locally - you would do this by using git bash and typing "ng serve" to start it. Then you can see it online with url 
localhost:4200. Making changes on a hosted website - If you have made changes to your website in atom when it is already uploaded the you 
have to save it on atom and then go into gitbash, I then typed the command "firebasedeploy" This will update your website once again and 
let everyone use the lattest version of your website. To update your code in git hub you have to type in "git add" and then "git commit" and 
then finaly "git push" to push up all of the new infomation up into git hub and then it will have te latest version of your website. And all 
of your code.

  ///////
 /Clone/
///////

To clone you had to do te command git clone (link) and then it would make you a folder called MathsQuiz.
